"I hope this becomes a real thing"

# Who I am
Hi, my name is Marek. I am currently studying Computer Science at the Military Academy of Technology (WAT) in Warsaw, Poland. Having learned C# on my own, I decided it was a good time to start a long-term project. Options were different, I finally decided to work on a small video game.

# What I expect from this project
TBH, I don't know yet. I would like to use my C# skills in practice, so I believe writting a C#-based video game will be a great fun, especially that I have always enjoyed playing video games.
